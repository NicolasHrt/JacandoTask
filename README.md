# JacandoTask

Hey, here is the task you asked me to do. In this project you can add a user by filling out the form and click on the submit button, if there is any information missing the missing fields are highlighted in red. 

It wasn't asked but you can also see the list of users added in the database by clicking on the button list of users. There is also a paging system to see all the user's information (4 users per page).


## Prerequisites

To run the projet you have to install nodeJs on your computer https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing nodejs, you have to go in the server directory and run the command ```npm run start``` to run the server

To run the front-end application, you have go in the front directory and run the commmand ```npm run dev```

## Technologies

I make the front with the framework NuxtJs/VueJs and the back with NodeJs (MongoDB for database).
